# Cake Model

The cake model is a chocolate cake with a cherry on top.  It is designed
as a model to be used as a goal object in a simulation, but of course
can be used in any way you could use a standard model.

* cake1.blend -- Blender file with a shiny cherry on top.  This model
  cannot be imported into Unity because Unity doesn't understand the
  nodes-based shading process, I think.  cake1.png is based on this model.

* cake3.blend -- A simpler cherry model, using a simpler material, with a
  standard BSDF.   cake3.fbx is an export from this Blender file.
